# torch-transformers-multilabel

This codebase was built with PyTorch 1.11, Transformers 4.18.0 and Hugging Face datasets. 

To train a model, run

    python3 train.py --train [TRAIN_LANGUAGE] --dev [TRAIN_LANGUAGE] --test [TEST_LANGUAGE]
    
Use several languages in training or testing by connecting them with a hyphen. E.g., en-fi-sv.
  
With the slurm script, you can launch multiple instances:

    sbatch slurm_train_arg.sh [TRAIN_LANGUAGE] [TEST_LANGUAGE] [LRs] [EPOCHSs] [INSTANCEs]
    
To predict labels for a text file (several texts when separated by linebreak):
    
    python3 predict.py --text text.txt --load_model model.pt
